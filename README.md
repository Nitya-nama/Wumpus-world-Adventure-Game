# Wumpus-world-Adventure-Game
This Python implementation simulates the classic Wumpus World game, a grid-based puzzle where the player must navigate a dangerous environment to find and safely exit the maze. The game includes a hunter (the agent) who must avoid hazards like pits, the Wumpus, and use clues (stench, breeze) to find the gold and exit.
